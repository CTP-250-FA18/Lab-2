# Lab-2

In this lab, you will demonstrate your understanding of recursion and basic class syntax. There are 2 programs to be completed. All files require Javadoc documentation comments at the top to include a description of the program, the @file tag, and an @author tag with your name.  The class specification file developed in part 2 requires complete Javadoc documentation comments for all public members.  Note: Your output does not need to match the sample shown.
